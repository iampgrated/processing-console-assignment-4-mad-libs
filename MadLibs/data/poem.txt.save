All the World's a Stage by William Shakespeare



All the world's a <noun>,
And all the <noun> and <noun> <adjective> players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one <noun> in his time <verb> many parts,
His <verb> being seven ages. At first, the infant,
<verb> and <verb> in the nurse's <noun>.
Then the <verb> schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining <adjective> face, <verb> like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like <noun>, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' <noun>. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the <noun>,
Jealous in honor, sudden and <Adjective> in <verb>,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's <noun>. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and <adjective> pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward <adjective> treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second <adjective> and mere oblivion,
Sans <noun>, sans <noun>, sans <verb>, sans everything.
